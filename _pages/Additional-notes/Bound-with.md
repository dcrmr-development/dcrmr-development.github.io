## 9.45.3 General rule

<a name="9.45.3.1">9.45.3.1</a> Record this relationship as a structured note, beginning with the words “bound with” followed by a colon. List the related items, in the order in which they are found. List all related items in the description for the first item and, in general, only the first item in the descriptions for the subsequent items. 

<a name="9.45.3.2">9.45.3.2</a> For each item listed, give only the elements listed below:

a) The RDA Creator agent of work (see [RDA Toolkit: Creator agent of work](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-6277a869-961d-379f-8ae8-7ec159052a26){:target="_blank"}); normally give this element first, usually in access point form (e.g., with inversion of personal names under surname, but not necessarily including personal birth/death dates, corporate qualifiers, etc.)

b) The [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as found in the description for the manifestation; long titles may be shortened by omitting words after the first five (or, if the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) begins with an article, the first six words). Use the mark of omission. If the preferred title of work is considered useful for the identification of the work, record it within square brackets preceding the title of manifestation

c) The primary [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/) as recorded in the description for the manifestation, unless it already recorded as RDA Creator agent of work or is exceedingly lengthy (see [RDA Toolkit: Creator agent of work](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-6277a869-961d-379f-8ae8-7ec159052a26){:target="_blank"}) 

d) The [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/) as found in the description for the manifestation, abridged as necessary, without using the mark of omission
