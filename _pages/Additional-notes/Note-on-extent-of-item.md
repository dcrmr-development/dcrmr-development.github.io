## 9.43.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="9.43.2.1">9.43.2.1</a> A note on item that provides information on the extent of an item.

## 9.43.3 General rule

<a name="9.43.3.1">9.43.3.1</a> For general rules on constructing item-specific notes, see [Note on item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item/) ([9.4.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item/#9.4.3.1)).

<a name="9.43.3.2">9.43.3.2</a> Record item-specific imperfections that alter its extent if considered important (see [Extent of manifestation, 6.21.428.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#6.21.428.1)).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Library copy 1: Imperfect: leaves 12 and 13 (b6 and c1) wanting; without the last blank leaf (S8)</CITE>

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Library copy imperfect: lacking the first four leaves (title page and index) and final blank leaf; first four leaves replaced with photostat copies</CITE>

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Library copy incomplete; all after page 142 wanting</CITE>  

<a name="9.43.3.3">9.43.3.3</a> Record the presence of a case or portfolio not issued with the manifestation in a Note on extent of item if considered important (see [Extent of manifestation, 6.21.4285.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#6.21.4285.2)).

<a name="9.43.3.4">9.43.3.4</a> Make a Note on extent of item when the number of physical units in which an item is bound differs from the number in which it was actually issued if considered important (see [Extent of manifestation, 6.21.431.3](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#6.21.431.3)).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Library copy bound in four physical volumes and interleaved with a Latin translation of Plutarch’s Lives</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The manifestation was issued in one volume)

<a name="9.43.3.5.Y.Y">9.43.3.5.Y.Y</a> For incomplete manifestations issued in multiple units (see 6.21.SOMETHING.SOMETHING.), provide details of units missing from the item in hand in a Note on extent of item if considered important.

>**Example:**  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>10 photographs</CITE>  
>Note on extent of item: <CITE>Repository lacks numbers 2 and 7</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)  

<a name="9.43.3.6.Y.Y">9.43.3.6.Y.Y</a> If the number of units issued cannot be determined, record in the Extent of manifestation the number and carrier extent units  of the item in hand, followed by "(incomplete)". Record the imperfection in a Note on extent of item if considered important (see 6.21.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).
