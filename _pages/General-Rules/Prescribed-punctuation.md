## 0.2.01 General rule

The PCC has issued [guidelines for minimally punctuated records](https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/PCC-Guidelines-for-Minimally-Punctuated-MARC-Data-v.1.2.docx), effective January 2020 and updated in October 2020. Catalogers creating DCRMR records should apply the punctuation practices of their own institutions, where applicable. Libraries applying ISBD punctuation may apply the following guidelines for prescribed punctuation. For more detailed instructions on punctuation for each ISBD area of description than those provided, see the Element order section of each chapter. For more complete guidance, see [ISBD](https://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/isbd/isbd-cons_20110321.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

<a name="0.2.01.1">0.2.01.1</a> Precede each mark of prescribed punctuation by a space and follow it by a space, with the following exceptions: the comma, period, closing parenthesis, and closing square bracket are not preceded by a space; the opening parenthesis and opening square bracket are not followed by a space. The colon after introductory wording is not preceded by a space.

<a name="0.2.01.2">0.2.01.2</a> If adjacent elements are to be enclosed in square brackets, each is enclosed in its own pair of square brackets.

<a name="0.2.01.3">0.2.01.3</a> End paragraphs with normal punctuation (usually the period).

<a name="0.2.01.4">0.2.01.4</a> If an entire element is omitted from the bibliographic description (e.g., because it is not present in the source), also omit its corresponding prescribed punctuation. Do not use the mark of omission.

<a name="0.2.01.5">0.2.01.5</a> Precede each element, other than the first element and statement of responsibility, by a period-space-em dash-space unless the element begins a new paragraph. Use a double-hyphen if the cataloging system cannot produce an em dash.

## 0.2.1 Title 

<a name="0.2.1.1">0.2.1.1</a> Precede the title of a supplement or section by a period. Precede each parallel title by an equals sign. Precede each unit of other title information by a colon.

*Still image exception*: Titles for still images resources will often not lend themselves easily to prescribed punctuation. In case of doubt, treat the entire statement as the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/).

<a name="0.2.1.2">0.2.1.2</a> For manifestations with no collective title, separate the titles by a space-semicolon-space if the works are all by the same entity, even if the titles are linked by a connecting word or phrase. If the individual works are by different entities or the attribution of all to the same entity is in doubt, precede each title other than the first by a period and one space, unless a linking word or phrase is already present. Precede each statement of responsibility by a space-slash-space.

## 0.2.2 Statement of responsibility

<a name="0.2.2.1">0.2.2.1</a> Precede the first statement of responsibility by a slash. Precede each subsequent statement of responsibility by a semicolon.

## 0.2.3 Edition

<a name="0.2.3.1">0.2.3.1</a> Precede the edition statement by a period-space-em dash-space. Precede a statement relating to a named revision of an edition by a comma. Precede the first statement of responsibility following an edition statement by a slash. Precede each subsequent statement of responsibility by a semicolon.

## 0.2.5 Production, publication, distribution, manufacture

<a name="0.2.5.1">0.2.5.1</a> Precede production, publication, distribution, or manufacture statements by a period-space-em dash-space. Precede a second or subsequently named place of production, publication, distribution, or manufacture by a semicolon, unless a linking word or phrase is given in the resource. Precede the name of the first producer, publisher, distributor, or manufacturer by a colon. Precede the name of a second and any subsequent name by a colon, unless a linking word or phrase is given in the resource. Precede the date of production, publication, distribution, or manufacture by a comma.

## 0.2.6 Physical description

<a name="0.2.6.1">0.2.6.1</a> Precede information on illustrative content by a colon. Precede the dimensions by a semicolon. Enclose bibliographic format in parentheses. Precede a statement of accompanying material by a plus sign. Enclose physical details of accompanying material in parentheses.

## 0.2.8 Series

<a name="0.2.8.1">0.2.8.1</a> Enclose each series statement in parentheses. Precede each parallel title by an equals sign. Precede other title information by a colon. Precede the first statement of responsibility by a slash. Precede each subsequent statement of responsibility by a semicolon. Precede the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) of a series or subseries by a comma. Precede the numbering within a series or subseries by a semicolon. Enclose a date following a numeric and/or alphabetic designation in parentheses. Precede the title of a subseries, or the designation for a subseries, by a period unless following a designation for a subseries, in which case precede the title of a subseries by a comma.

## 0.2.9 Notes

<a name="0.2.9.1">0.2.9.1</a> Start a new paragraph for each note. End each paragraph with a period or other mark of final punctuation. Separate introductory wording from the main content of a note by a colon followed but not preceded by a space. 

## 0.2.95 Identifiers

<a name="0.2.95.1">0.2.95.1</a> Precede this element by a period-space-em dash-space or start a new paragraph. Precede each repetition of this element by a period-space-em dash-space. Precede terms of availability by a colon. Enclose a qualification to the standard number or terms of availability in parentheses.
