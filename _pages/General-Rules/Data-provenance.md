## 0.1.1 Recording a content standard

<a name="0.1.1.1">0.1.1.1</a> See [Appendix A. MARC 21 Descriptive Conventions Code](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-a/) for guidance. 

## 0.1.2 Basis of the description

### 0.1.21 General rule

<a name="0.1.21.1">0.1.21.1</a> Base the description on the item in hand.

### 0.1.22 Imperfect exemplars of a manifestation

<a name="0.1.22.1">0.1.22.1</a> **General rule**. If describing an exemplar of a manifestation known to be imperfect (e.g., lacking pages, physically damaged, missing information present in a complete copy), and details of a perfect (or more perfect) copy can be determined, base the description on the perfect copy. Do not use square brackets to record information present in the perfect copy but absent in the imperfect copy. Details of a perfect (or more perfect) copy may be determined by examining additional items, by examining facsimiles of perfect copies, or by referring to reliable descriptions in other sources. Cite the source used for the description (see [Note on title, 1.29.31](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#12931-note-on-the-source-of-the-title-proper) and [Manifestation described by, 9.32.31](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/#93231-references-to-published-descriptions)). Make an item-level note describing the imperfection of the item in hand if considered important (see [Modification of item, 9.41.3.2](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Modification-of-item/#9.41.3.2)).

<a name="0.1.22.2">0.1.22.2</a> **Details of a perfect copy cannot be determined**. If no reliable evidence of the details of a perfect copy is available, describe the imperfect item as it is. Use the mark of omission or supply a conjecture enclosed in square brackets to indicate lacunae as needed (see [Transcription, 0.4.63.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.4.63.1)). Make a [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) indicating that the description is based on an imperfect copy (see [9.3.37.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9.3.37.1)).

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>Carta de […] sitio de Puebla</CITE>  
>Note on manifestation: <CITE>Description based on an imperfect copy; section of map missing at top, affecting text</CITE>

<a name="0.1.22.3">0.1.22.3</a> **Multipart monographs or serials**. If the first volume or issue is lacking or imperfect to the degree that it impedes identification or access, and details of a perfect (or more perfect) copy cannot be determined, then base the description on the earliest available volume or issue that can supply the details necessary for the description.

<a name="0.1.22.4">0.1.22.4</a>  **Resources for which the concept of perfect copy does not apply**. If describing resources for which the concept of perfect copy does not apply, describe the resource as it is. Such resources include unpublished items, such as manuscript maps and original works of art, as well as unique books or unique assemblages of published items, such as composite atlases. Use the mark of omission or supply a conjecture enclosed in square brackets to indicate lacunae as needed (see [Transcription, 0.4.63.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.4.63.1)). Always make a [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) describing the imperfection of the resource in hand (see [9.3.37.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9.3.37.1)).

## 0.1.3 Preferred source of information

### 0.1.31 Manifestations consisting of more than one page, leaf, sheet, or card

<a name="0.1.31.1">0.1.31.1</a> For resources that consist of more than one page, leaf, sheet, or card, use the title page, title sheet, or title card as the preferred source of information. If information traditionally given on the title page is given on two facing pages or on pages on successive leaves, with or without repetition, treat all of these pages as the preferred source and make a [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) (see [9.3.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9.3.3.1)) or other appropriate note.

*Exception*: Treat half-titles or added non-letterpress title pages as separate sources of information.

<a name="0.1.31.2">0.1.31.2</a> Treat facing pages or pages on successive leaves in different languages or scripts as a single source of information. For multiple sources of information in different languages and scripts, see [0.1.35.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.35.1).

<a name="0.1.31.3">0.1.31.3</a> However, if the manifestation bears a cover or case issued with the resource that contains all the elements typically given on a title page and has more recent information than that provided on the title page, title sheet, or title card (e.g., a later edition statement and publication date), choose the cover as the preferred source of information. Make a note to indicate that the cover has been chosen as the preferred source (see [1.29.31.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.31.1)).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Poetry of animated nature illustrated : a chaste, interesting and instructive present for juveniles. -- Second edition. -- Philadelphia : Published by Robert A. Smith, 1848</CITE>  
Note on manifestation: <CITE>Title, edition statement, and imprint taken from printed wrapper<CITE>  
> (Title page reads: Poetry of animated nature illustrated. In a series of numbers. Philadelphia: Published by Robert A. Smith, 1846)  
>>(*Comment*: Information is transcribed in four elements: [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/); [Other title information](/DCRMR/title/Other-title-information/); [Edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Edition-statement/); and [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/). The example is formatted according to ISBD for clarity)

<a name="0.1.31.4.Y.Y">0.1.31.4.Y.Y</a> For resources that consist of more than one page, leaf, sheet, or card issued without a title page, title sheet, or title card (and for manifestations issued *with* a title page when the title page is missing and no reliable description of it is available), if a single [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) is available in a single source within the manifestation, use this source as the preferred source. If the same [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) is available in more than one source within the manifestation, choose as the title page substitute the source that supplies the most additional information. If different titles, or differing forms of the same title, appear within the manifestation, choose as the preferred source the source within the manifestation in which the information is most formally presented. If there is no formal presentation of a title within the manifestation or if differing titles are presented equally formally, choose as the preferred source one of the following, in this order of preference:

+ a colophon
+ a source within the preliminaries
+ a caption title
+ a cover integral to the resource
+ a source elsewhere within the resource

Make a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) indicating the source chosen as the title page substitute (see [1.29.31.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.31.1)).

### 0.1.32 Single-sheet manifestations

<a name="0.1.32.1">0.1.32.1</a> If the manifestation consists of a single sheet, use as the preferred source of information the first of the following sources that has a title:

+ the whole sheet, including both sides and any permanently affixed labels issued with the resource
+ an original container or case issued with the resource (e.g., a  portfolio, cover, or envelope)
+ other accompanying material provided by the creator or creating body (e.g., a photographer's logbook, a caption card)

### 0.1.33 Multiple unit resources

<a name="0.1.33.1">0.1.33.1</a> If the manifestation is a multiple unit resource, choose as the preferred source of information the source identifying the manifestation as a whole, preferring a source that has a collective title, regardless of whether or not the parts are numbered.

### 0.1.335.Y.Y Born-digital still images

<a name="0.1.335.1.Y.Y">0.1.335.1.Y.Y</a> For born-digital still images (e.g. digital camera photography, computer-generated architectural renderings) the preferred source of information is the resource itself, including digitally embedded metadata.

### 0.1.35 More than one preferred source of information

<a name="0.1.35.1">0.1.35.1</a> If there is more than one source of information that qualifies as the preferred source of information for the manifestation, choose as the preferred source of information one of the following, applying the first applicable criterion:

+ **Preferred sources of information for the reproduction and the original**  
If the manifestation is a facsimile or reproduction of an original manifestation and the manifestation contains a preferred source of information for the reproduction as well as a preferred source of information for the original, then use the source for the reproduction as the preferred source.
+ **Preferred sources of information with different dates**  
If a manifestation is not a multipart monograph or serial and the manifestation contains preferred sources of information with different dates, then use the source with the later or latest date.
+ **Preferred sources of information in letterpress and non-letterpress**  
If the manifestation contains one preferred source that is in letterpress and one that is not (e.g., engraved), use the source that is in letterpress.
+ **Preferred sources of information in different languages or scripts**  
If the manifestation contains preferred sources in more than one language or script, use as the preferred source (in this order of preference):
     1. the source in the language or script that corresponds to the language or script of the content of the resource
     2. the source in the language or script that corresponds to the predominant language or script of the content of the resource  
     3. the source in the language or script of translation, if the resource contains the same work in more than one language or script and translation is known to be the purpose of the resource  
     4. the source in the original language or script of the content, if the resource contains the same content in more than one language or script and the original language or script can be identified
     5. the first occurring of the sources
     6. the source in the language or script preferred by the agency preparing the description, if the resource is formatted *tête-bêche*, as a head-to-head bound monograph, or as a head-to-tail bound monograph.
+ **Order of sources of information**  
If two title pages face one another, choose the one on the recto of its leaf. If two or more title pages follow one another, choose the first one.

Make a note indicating the source chosen as the preferred source of information if other than the usual title page, or, in a multipart manifestation, if other than the title page of the first volume.

*Hereafter, "title page" means "title page or title page substitute."*

## 0.1.5 Sources of information

<a name="0.1.5.1">0.1.5.1</a> The source(s) of information for each element are set out in preferred order below:

| Elements                                               | Sources of Information |
| ---------------------------                            | ---------------------- |
| Title                                                  | Title page; whole sheet for single-sheet manifestations |
| Statement of responsibility                            | Title page; whole sheet for single-sheet manifestations |
| Edition                                                | Title page, other preliminaries, colophon, dust jacket; whole sheet for single-sheet manifestations |
| Production, publication, distribution, manufacture | Title page, other preliminaries, colophon, dust jacket; whole sheet for single-sheet manifestations |
| Physical description                                   | The whole manifestation |
| Series                                                 | Series title page, monograph title page, cover, dust jacket, rest of manifestation |
| Notes                                                  | Any source |
| Identifiers                                             | Any source |

<a name="0.1.5.2">0.1.5.2</a> Transcribe information from the source for title, statement of responsibility, edition, production, publication, distribution, manufacture, and series only if it is present in the source of information for that element. In all cases in which information for these elements is taken from a source other than the title page (or series title page for series), always make a note to indicate the source of information (see note instructions for individual elements).

## 0.1.7 Recording a source of information that is not the manifestation being described

<a name="0.1.7.1">0.1.7.1</a> If the manifestation does not provide a source of information for an element, take the information from one of the following sources (in order of preference):

+ a reference source (e.g., a bibliography or catalog)
+ other descriptions of the manifestation (e.g., a dealer’s description, a prospectus)
+ any other source (e.g., a container that is not issued with the manifestation itself, or accompanying material that is not treated as part of the manifestation itself)

<a name="0.1.7.2">0.1.7.2</a> When the instructions specify transcription, indicate that the information is supplied from a source outside the manifestation itself by enclosing the information in square brackets. Make a note to indicate the source of information.

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>[The great triumphal chariot of Maximilian I]</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from Bartsch</CITE>   
>>(*Comment*: The formal citation for Bartsch is given in a [Manifestation described by](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/) note (see [9.32.31.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/#9.32.31.1)))
