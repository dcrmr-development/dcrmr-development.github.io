## 5.1.21.Y.Y DCRMR elaboration of scope

<a name="5.1.21.1.Y.Y">5.1.21.1.Y.Y</a> Use this element to record [Place of production](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-production/) and [Date of production](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-production/) for unpublished materials. Do not record [RDA Toolkit: Name of producer](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-afdb9990-0d14-33ef-83f0-e514f188e95f){:target="_blank"}.

In case of doubt, treat the resource as unpublished, and record information on its inscription, fabrication, construction, etc. in Production statement.

## 5.1.3.Y.Y General rule

<a name="5.1.3.1.Y.Y">5.1.3.1.Y.Y</a> Transcribe the Production statement in the form and order in which it is presented on the preferred source of information, unless specifically instructed otherwise (see [Transcription, 0.4.94.05](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.4.94.05)).

## 5.1.31.Y.Y Information covered by labels, etc.

If the original details are visible or otherwise available, always transcribe or give them in a [Note on production statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-production-statement/) (see 5.14.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

<a name="5.1.31.2.Y.Y">5.1.31.2.Y.Y</a> For printed materials with manuscript information, use judgment in determining whether or not the manuscript information should be transcribed as the production  statement or as item-specific information.
