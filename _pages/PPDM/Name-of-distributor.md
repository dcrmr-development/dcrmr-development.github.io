<a name="5.27.3.2">5.27.3.2</a> *Optionally*, omit, using the mark of omission, addresses and insignificant information appearing with the distributor's name, unless the information is grammatically inseparable, aids in identifying or dating the manifestation, or is deemed important to the cataloging agency (e.g., for the purpose of capturing book trade data).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>To be sold by David Mortier, bookseller in the Strand, …</CITE>  
>>(*Source of information reads*: To be sold by David Mortier, bookseller in the Strand, near the Fountain-Tavern at the sign of Erasmus's Head, where also are to be sold all sort of maps)

## 5.27.31 Two or more names of distributors

<a name="5.27.31.1">5.27.31.1</a> If the [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/) includes more than one distributor in a single source, transcribe all the names in the order indicated by the sequence, layout, or typography of the names on the source of information. Transcribe them as subsequent Names of distributor only when they are not linked by connecting words or phrases.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Prostant apud Jac. & Joh. Knapton, R. Knaplock, J. Groenewegen, & N. Prevost bibliopolas Londinenses</CITE>  

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Sold by Messrs. Fletcher and Son, also Merril, at Cambridge, Debrett, Egerton, Kearsley, Bew, and Swell, in London and Tesseyman, at York</CITE>

<a name="5.27.31.2">5.27.31.2</a> *Optionally*, if the names are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of omitted names in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Sold by E. Williams, no. 11, Strand, W. & W. Clarke, Market-Place, and Robinson & Ellis, St. Ann’s Place, Manchester [and 3 others in 2 other places]</CITE>

<a name="5.27.31.3">5.27.31.3</a> If both the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) and name of distributor associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) and name of distributor of the manifestation being described, transcribe each distributor with the place to which it corresponds.

## 5.27.32 Names of distributors in multipart monographs

<a name="5.27.32.1">5.27.32.1</a> If the manifestation is issued in more than one physical part and the distributor or the distributor’s form of name changes in the course of publication, transcribe as Name of distributor the name in the first or earliest part and always record the distributor’s name in the later part(s) in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.1)).

## 5.27.33 Names of distributors containing grammatically inseparable place names or dates

<a name="5.27.33.1">5.27.33.1</a> If the Name of distributor contains grammatically inseparable statements relating to [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) or [Date of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/), transcribe them as part of the Name of distributor. Supply the [Place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-distribution/) or [Date of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-distribution/) in square brackets in the appropriate element.

>**Example:**  
>Place of distribution: <CITE>[London]</CITE>  
>Name of distributor: <CITE>Prostant apud S. Smith & B. Walford bibliopolas Londinenses</CITE>  

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Place of distribution: [Bristol]</CITE>   
>Name of distributor: <CITE>Sold by Lasbury, Bristol</CITE>  

## 5.27.34 Fictitious or incorrect names of distributor

<a name="5.27.34.1">5.27.34.1</a> If the name of the distributor appearing on the manifestation is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and always make an explanatory [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.2](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.2)).

<a name="5.27.34.2">5.27.34.2</a> If the name as transcribed is known to be fictitious or incorrect and the actual name is known or can be reasonably surmised, transcribe it as it appears and supply the actual name, preceded by “that is,” all enclosed within square brackets. Always give the basis for the correction or clarification in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.3](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.3)).

## 5.27.35 Supplied and conjectured names of distributors

<a name="5.27.35.1">5.27.35.1</a> If no name, address, or device of a distributor appears on the manifestation but the distributor’s name is known or can be reasonably surmised, supply it in square brackets if known. If the supplied Name of distributor is uncertain, either add a question mark to any supplied name or give the information in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/). In any case of a supplied distributor, provide a justification in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.4)).

## 5.27.36 Names of distributors containing only addresses, signs, initials, or devices

<a name="5.27.36.1">5.27.36.1</a> If only an address, sign, or initials of the distributor appears in lieu of the name, transcribe the statement containing the address, sign, or initials as Name of distributor. If the distributor’s name can be identified, supply it in square brackets after the initials or before or after the address or sign, as appropriate, or give the information in a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) (see [5.285.34.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.5)).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>To be sold in Ffletestrete [by R. Foster] at the signe of the Croune, nexte vnto the Whyte Fryres gate</CITE>

<a name="5.27.36.2">5.27.36.2</a>  If the identification of the distributor is based on a device, supply the name of the distributor in square brackets, even if the device includes the distributor’s initials or spelled-out name. Always make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) about the basis for the identification (see [5.285.34.6](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.6)).

## 5.27.37 Name of distributor cannot be supplied

<a name="5.27.37.1">5.27.37.1</a> If no distributor’s name can be conjectured, record  “distributor not identified” in square brackets if considered important.

## 5.27.38 Name of distributor transcribed as part of another element

<a name="5.27.38.1">5.27.38.1</a> If the name of the distributor does not appear in the [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/), but has already been transcribed as part of another element, supply it within square brackets.

If transcribing a distributor name as part of another element, do not abridge or expand the name of distributor simply because it repeats or omits information given elsewhere in the description.

>**Example:**  
>Name of distributor: <CITE>[Joannem Annison]</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The name of the distributor has already been transcribed as part of the title, which reads “Catalogus librorum qui prostant apud Joannem Anisson, typographiae regiae directorem, viâ Jacobaeâ, sub Lilio Florentino)

## 5.27.39 Name of distributor in more than one language or script

<a name="5.27.39.1">5.27.39.1</a> If the distributor’s name appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the name in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as Name of distributor. If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the name that appears first as Name of distributor. Transcribe the remaining distributor name(s) as [Parallel name of distributor](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-name-of-distributor/). For transposed elements, always make a [Note on distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source (see [5.285.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-distribution-statement/#5.285.34.7)).

>**Example:**  
>Name of distributor: <CITE>Prostant apud S. Baker, T. Cadell, D. Wilson, G. Nicol, et J. Murray</CITE>  
>Parallel name of distributor: <CITE>By S. Baker and G. Leigh, in York-Street; T. Cadell in the Strand; D. Wilson and G. Nicol, opposite York-Buildings; and J. Murray, in Fleet-Street</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The text in Latin appears first on the title page. The [Parallel place of distribution](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-place-of-distribution/) is “Sold in London”)
