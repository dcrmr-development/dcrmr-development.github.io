<a name="5.115.1.2.Y.Y">5.115.1.2.Y.Y</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/ppdm/#5011-sources-of-information)

## 5.115.2.Y.Y RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.115.2.1.Y.Y">5.115.2.1.Y.Y</a> A place of production in another language or script.

## 5.115.3.Y.Y General rule

<a name="5.115.3.1.Y.Y">5.115.3.1.Y.Y</a> Take parallel places of production from the same source as the [Place of production](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-production/). Make a [Note on production statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-production-statement/) on parallel places of production found elsewhere if considered important (see 5.14.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

<a name="5.115.3.2.Y.Y">5.115.3.2.Y.Y</a> For transposed elements, always make a [Note on production statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-production-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source (see 5.14.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

<a name="5.115.3.3.Y.Y">5.115.3.3.Y.Y</a> If the place of production appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as [Place of production](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-production/). If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the place that appears first as [Place of production](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-production/).

<a name="5.115.3.4.Y.Y">5.115.3.4.Y.Y</a> Transcribe remaining places of production appearing on the same source as the [Place of production](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-production/) as Parallel places of production. If a parallel place of production is from a different source than the [Place of production](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-production/), make a [Note on production statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-production-statement/) if considered important (see 5.14.SOMETHONG.SOMETHING).

<a name="5.115.3.5.Y.Y">5.115.3.5.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel production places are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of omitted places in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.
