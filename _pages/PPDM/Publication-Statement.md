## 5.2.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="5.2.2.1">5.2.2.1</a> A statement that identifies a place of publication, a publisher, or a date of publication of a published manifestation.

<a name="5.2.2.2">5.2.2.2</a> A publication statement includes a statement about the publication, release, or issuing of a published manifestation.

## 5.2.3 General rule

<a name="5.2.3.1">5.2.3.1</a> Transcribe the Publication statement in the form and order in which it is presented on the preferred source of information, unless specifically instructed otherwise (see [Transcription, 0.4.94.05](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.4.94.05)).

## 5.2.31 Information covered by labels, etc.

<a name="5.2.31.1">5.2.31.1</a> If any of the original details relating to the publication statement are covered by a label, stamp, overprint, or other means showing later information, transcribe the later information. If the original details are visible or otherwise available, always transcribe or give them in a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) (see [5.24.31.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.31.4)).

>Note on publication statement: <CITE>Imprint from label which covers earlier imprint: Chez Francois Marret, marchand libraire sur le marché aux fleurs</CITE>

<a name="5.2.31.2">5.2.31.2</a> For printed materials with manuscript information, use judgment in determining whether or not the manuscript information should be transcribed as the publication statement or as item-specific information. In case of doubt, consider the manuscript information to be item-specific information and record as a [Note on item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item/) (see [9.4.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-item/#9.4.3.1)).

## 5.2.32 Elements relating to publication vs. elements relating to distribution or manufacture

<a name="5.2.32.1">5.2.32.1</a> Statements relating to distribution or manufacture will sometimes be more appropriately transcribed as elements of publication, and sometimes as elements of distribution or manufacture. The roles of publishers, printers, and booksellers were not clearly delimited in the hand-press period. Statements relating to distribution or manufacture frequently appear prominently on early printed materials, reflecting the tendency of booksellers or printers to function as more than solely distributors or manufacturers. As the book trade industry became increasingly specialized over time, however, the role of the publisher gradually emerged as dominant, while manufacturer and distributor gradually diminished in importance.

## 5.2.33 Statements relating to publication only

<a name="5.2.33.1">5.2.33.1</a> If the resource bears only a statement relating to publication, or multiple such statements, treat the statement as a publication statement.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Geneuae : Sumptibus Petri Chouët, M.DC.LI [1651]</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

## 5.2.335 Statements relating to manufacture or distributor only

<a name="5.2.335.1">5.2.335.1</a> If the resource bears only a statement relating to manufacture, or multiple such statements, generally assume the manufacturer to also be functioning as publisher. Treat the statement as a publication statement.

>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

<a name="5.2.335.2">5.2.335.2</a> If the resource bears only a statement relating to distribution, or multiple such statements, generally assume the distributor to also be functioning as publisher. Treat the statement as a publication statement. 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>[London] : Se vend chez A. Dulau et Co. Soho-Square; De Boffe, Gerard-Street; Boosey, Royal Exchange; Booker, Bond-Street; L’Homme New Bond-Street, et chez les principaux libraires du royaume, 1800</CITE>

>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

<a name="5.2.335.3">5.2.335.3</a> If the resource lacks a statement relating to publication and the resource bears statements relating to both distribution and manufacture, then determine whether or not the statements are grammatically separable. 

<a name="5.2.335.4">5.2.335.4</a> If a statement relating to both distribution and manufacture is grammatically inseparable, treat them both as the publication statement. 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>London : Printed by G. Paramore, North-Green, Worship-Street, and sold by G. Whitfield, at the Chapel in the City-Road, and at all the Methodist preaching-houses in town and country, 1792</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

<a name="5.2.335.5">5.2.335.5</a> If grammatically separable, determine which statement is emphasized in the source, whether typographically (larger font size, uppercase letters, boldface, etc.) or by appearing first in sequence in the source, and treat that statement as a publication statement. Treat the other statement as a [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/) or [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/).

## 5.2.34 Statements relating to publication and to distribution or manufacture

<a name="5.2.34.1">5.2.34.1</a> If the resource bears statements relating both to publication and to distribution or manufacture, determine whether or not the statements are grammatically separable. 

<a name="5.2.34.2">5.2.34.2</a> If a distribution or manufacture statement is grammatically separable, treat the distribution statement as a [Distribution statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Distribution-statement/) or manufacture statement as a [Manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Manufacture-statement/).

<a name="5.2.34.3">5.2.34.3</a> If the statements are grammatically inseparable, transcribe them as a Publication statement. 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>London : Printed for the author, and published by J. Bew, Pater-Noster-Row, MDCCLXXIX [1779]</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Boston : Printed by Robert Hodge, for Nathaniel Coverly, in Newbury-Street, [1782]</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

>**Example:**  
><CITE>London : Pour Robert Scott & se vend chez Geo. Wells, & Sam. Carr, dans le cymitiere de St. Paul, 1678</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

<a name="5.2.34.4">5.2.34.4</a> If a statement with grammatically inseparable elements contains information relating both to the publication of the resource and to the agents who have contributed to its intellectual or artistic content, use judgment in deciding whether to transcribe the statement as part of the Publication statement or as a [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/) (see [2.21.38.2](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/#2.21.38.2)). Often the layout of the source will suggest the appropriate treatment.

## 5.2.35 No publication statement

<a name="5.2.35.1">5.2.35.1</a> If the resource lacks a statement relating to publication and the identity of the publisher can be determined or reasonably surmised, supply the publication information in square  brackets and make a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) to justify supplied information (see [5.24.31.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.31.5)). 

>**Example:**   
>Publication statement: <CITE>[Passy, France] : [Benjamin Franklin], [1781]</CITE>  
>Note on publication statement: <CITE>Imprint from Livingston</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The formal citation for Livingston’s bibliography of Franklin’s press at Passy is given in a [Manifestation described by](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/) note (see [9.32.31.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/#9.32.31.1)). The example is formatted according to ISBD for clarity)
