<a name="5.11.36.2.Y.Y">5.11.36.2.Y.Y</a> If the place name is known to be fictitious or incorrect and the actual Place of production is known or can be reasonably surmised, transcribe it as it appears and supply the actual place name, preceded by "that is," all enclosed within square brackets.

Keep in mind that when the item in hand is a drawing or a photographic print of a place, it was not necessarily produced in that place.

<a name="5.11.385.2.Y.Y">5.11.385.2.Y.Y</a> If no city of production can be conjectured, supply the name of a state, province, country, or other larger geographic entity as the place of production with a question mark if necessary, using a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency in square brackets.

<a name="5.11.385.3.Y.Y">5.11.385.3.Y.Y</a> If the basis of the supplied place is not apparent from the rest of the description, always make a [Note on production statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-production-statement/) to indicate the source of the information (see 5.14.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

<a name="5.11.385.4.Y.Y">5.11.385.4.Y.Y</a> If no place of production can be conjectured, record "Place of production not identified" in square brackets.

<a name="5.11.39.1.Y.Y">5.11.39.1.Y.Y</a> If the place of production appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as Place of production. If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the place that appears first as Place of production. Transcribe remaining place(s) as [Parallel place of production](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-place-of-production/). For transposed elements, always make a [Note on production statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-production-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source (see 5.14.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).
