## 8.01.1 Sources of information 

<a name="8.01.1.04.Y.Y">8.01.1.04.Y.Y</a> **Printed text resources**. The sources of information for series elements are the series title page, monograph title page, cover (if issued by the publisher), dust jacket, and the rest of the manifestation, in that order of preference (see [Data provenance, 0.1.5](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#015-sources-of-information)). For multipart monographs, prefer a source in the first volume. The preferred source of information for single-sheet manifestations is the whole sheet, including both sides. If the manifestation has both main series and subseries titles, prefer a source containing both titles. 

<a name="8.01.1.06.Y.Y">8.01.1.06.Y.Y</a> **Still image resources**. For still images issued without a title page, title sheet, or title card (that is, the majority of still images), the preferred source of information is text provided by the creator or issuing body anywhere on or with the manifestation (see Data provenance, 0.1.SOMETHING.SOMETHING). For still image resources with a title page, the preferred source of information is the title page, and catalogers should follow the instructions for non-single-sheet printed text resources (see [Data provenance, 0.1.5](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#015-sources-of-information)). If the manifestation has both series and subseries titles, prefer a source containing both titles. 

Series-like statements present on covers not issued by the publisher usually represent binders’ titles and should be treated as item-level information if considered important (see [Title of item, 1.27.31.1](/DCRMR/title/Title-of-item/#1.27.31.1)).

<a name="8.01.1.2">8.01.1.2</a> If the [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/), or any of its elements, is taken from a source other than the preferred source, always make a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) (see [8.29.3.2](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.3.2)).

<a name="8.01.1.25.Y.Y">8.01.1.25.Y.Y</a> **Still image resources**. Always make a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) to indicate the source of information for the [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/) (see [8.29.3.23.Y.Y](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.3.23.Y.Y)).

<a name="8.01.1.3">8.01.1.3</a> If the [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/) appears on both the series title page and the preferred source of information, indicate this in a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) if considered important (see [8.29.3.25.Y.Y](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.3.25.Y.Y)). Transcribe the text of the latter statement as a second [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/) if the two differ. 

<a name="8.01.1.35.Y.Y">8.01.1.35.Y.Y</a> Make a note about series information not transcribed in the [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/) if considered important (see [Note on series statement, 8.29.3.3](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.3.3)). 

<a name="8.01.1.4">8.01.1.4</a> If any of the original details relating to the series statement are covered by a label, stamp, overprint, or other means showing later information (e.g., burnished out, scored through), transcribe the later information. If the original details are visible or otherwise available, always transcribe or give them in a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) (see 8.29.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

<a name="8.01.1.5">8.01.1.5</a> If a [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/) is not present in the manifestation, but bibliographic or reference sources provide evidence that the manifestation was issued as part of a publisher’s series or a multiple unit, do not supply a [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/). Rather, provide the series information in a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) if considered important (see [8.29.3.2](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.3.2)).

<a name="8.01.2.3">8.01.2.3</a> If there are [Parallel titles of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/), transcribe each subseries after the series title to which it relates.

> Title of series. Title of subseries = Parallel title of series. Parallel title of subseries

<a name="8.01.2.4">8.01.2.4</a> Transcribe [Other title information of series](/DCRMR/series/Other-title-information-of-series/) following the [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/). If there are [Parallel titles of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/), transcribe the other title information after the series title to which it relates.

>Title of series : other title information of series = Parallel title of series

<a name="8.01.2.6">8.01.2.6</a> If there are [Parallel titles of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/) but the [Statement of responsibility relating to series](/DCRMR/series/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-series/) appears in only one language or script, transcribe the [Statement of responsibility relating to series](/DCRMR/series/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-series/) after the last parallel title, following any other title information associated with the title.

> Title of series : other title information of series = Parallel title of series : parallel other title information of series / statement of responsibility relating to series.

<a name="8.01.2.7">8.01.2.7</a> If the statement of responsibility appears in more than one language or script, transcribe each statement after the title of series (or other title information) to which it relates.

> Title of series : other title information of series / statement of responsibility relating to series = Parallel title of series : parallel other title information of series / parallel statement of responsibility relating to series

<a name="8.01.2.8">8.01.2.8</a> If series numbering is present, transcribe it as the last element in the [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/). 

> Title of series : other title information of series / statement of responsibility relating to series ; numbering within sequence

<a name="8.01.2.9">8.01.2.9</a> If there are [Parallel titles of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/) and the series numbering also appears in more than one language or script, transcribe each number after the series title to which it relates (following any other title information or any statement of responsibility associated with the title).

> Title of series : other title information of series / statement of responsibility relating to series ; numbering within sequence = Parallel title of series : parallel other title information of series / parallel statement of responsibility relating to series ; numbering within sequence [relating to [Parallel title of series](/DCRMR/series/Parallel-title-of-series/)]

<a name="8.01.2.91">8.01.2.91</a> If the series numbering appears only once, transcribe it after the series title to which it relates. 

> Title of series ; numbering within sequence [relating to Title within series] = Parallel title of series

<a name="8.01.2.92">8.01.2.92</a> However, if the numbering relates to all, more than one, or none of the series titles, transcribe it at the end of the [Series statement](/DCRMR/series/Series-statement/).

> Title of series = Parallel title of series ; numbering within sequence [relating to both the Title of series and the Parallel title of series]

## 8.01.3 Form and order of information 

<a name="8.01.3.1">8.01.3.1</a> Transcribe Series information in the form and order in which it is presented on the preferred source of information, unless specifically instructed otherwise (see [Transcription, 0.4.94.05](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.4.94.05)).
