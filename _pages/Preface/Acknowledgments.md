Writing a standard is intensive work performed by dedicated volunteers. Every member of the editorial group has given their time to this effort while also working full-time jobs and balancing their personal lives. The initial release of DCRMR was prepared in truly extraordinary circumstances. The release of the new RDA Toolkit in 2019 necessitated a full change in direction, leading the editorial group to create a new standard in less than two years. During this time, we faced the COVID-19 pandemic,  uprisings across the United States, and environmental disasters. Throughout this, the editorial group worked tirelessly to bring this work to fruition. No one accepts editorial responsibilities anticipating these challenges. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to every member of the RBMS RDA Editorial Group from its inception to the present:

+ Jessica Grzegorski, editor (2021-present) 
+ Elizabeth Hobart, editor (2019-present)
+ Michelle Mascaro, editor (2017-2020)
+ Liz Adams
+ Amy Brown 
+ kalan Knudson Davis
+ Tammy Druash
+ Ryan Hildebrand
+ Francis Lapka 
+ Deborah J. Leslie
+ Matthew J. Murphy
+ Iris O’Brien
+ Elizabeth O’Keefe
+ Audrey Pearson
+ Amy Tims

This work was not performed solely by the editorial group. Thanks as well to John Attig and Robert Maxwell for laying the foundation of this work and to all task force members through the development of this standard, including the Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials Task Force (2014-2017):

+ Francis Lapka, chair 
+ Morag Boyd
+ Valerie Buck
+ Ellen Cordes
+ Lori Dekydtspotter 
+ Christine DeZelar-Tiedman
+ Todd Fell
+ Jane Gillis 
+ Matthew Haugen 
+ Linda Isaac
+ Deborah J. Leslie
+ Nancy Lorimer 
+ Michelle Mascaro  
+ Iris O’Brien
+ Elizabeth O’Keefe 
+ Audrey Pearson 
+ Aislinn Sotelo 
+ Catherine Uecker 

The DCRM(B) for RDA Revision Group (2012-2014):

+ Francis Lapka, chair 
+ Morag Boyd
+ Lori Dekydtspotter
+ Robert Maxwell
+ Iris O’Brien 
+ Aislinn Sotelo
+ Catherine Uecker

And the DCRM-RDA Task Force (2011-2012):

+ Deborah J. Leslie, co-chair
+ Catherine Uecker, co-chair

In addition, support was provided by the examples group (a subgroup of the Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials Task Force), which identified illustrative examples and identified sources:

+ Morag Boyd 
+ Ellen Cordes 
+ Lori Dekydtspotter
+ Linda Isaac 
+ Iris O’Brien
+ Catherine Uecker

And by the glossary group:

+ Valerie Buck  
+ kalan Knudson Davis
+ Sarah Hoover  

Thanks as well to the members of the [Bibliographic Standards Committee](https://www.ala.org/acrl/rbms/acr-rbmbiblio){:target="_blank"} since work began in 2010.

Thanks especially to volunteer reviewers during the BSC review: Liz Adams, Matthew Beacom, Erin Blake, Jennifer Dunlap, Maggie Long, Ann Myers, Jackie Parascandola, Lauren Reno, Jessie Sherwood, and Brittney Washington. 

Our heartfelt thanks to the following libraries for generously providing meeting space for editorial group meetings: the Newberry Library (January 2015), the Houghton Library (January 2016), Georgia State University Library (January 2017), and the Folger Shakespeare Library (June 2019). Our deep thanks also to the Lewis Walpole Library for hosting biannual meetings of the Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials Task Force from 2014-2017. A special thank you to Ellen Cordes in particular for arranging the Walpole meeting, without which the Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials Task Force would not have been able to complete their charge.

Thanks also to Francis Lapka and Liz Adams for investigating hosting options for DCRMR. Their work ensured a sustainable, usable home for DCRMR. We also extend thanks to the RBMS Web Team and to BSC Web Team Liaison Jessica Grzegorski for creation of the bsc.rbms.info subdomain. Thanks also to Erin Blake for editing the image files for early letterforms and to Geoff Hobart for designing the navigation arrows and cover.

Finally, I want to acknowledge our keepers of the text and editors. Audrey Pearson served as keeper of the text from 2014. After Audrey completed her editorial group term in 2019, Amy Tims took over this responsibility, ensuring editorial consistency for the emergent standard. kalan Knudson Davis joined as co-keeper in 2020 and led the migration of the text to GitHub. It is no exaggeration to say that this work could not have been accomplished without kalan’s hard work and dedication. Finally, a huge thank you to Michelle Mascaro, who served as editor from July 2017 until June 2020. The successful completion of this text and final publication could not have happened without her years of tireless work.

Elizabeth Hobart  
Chief editor, RBMS RDA Editorial Group  (2019-2022)
