This release includes only instructions for cataloging books and still images. Additional formats will be added as they are developed.

Due to coordination with other organizations, notably the PCC, certain sections are being skipped for now, including [Precataloging Decisions](/DCRMR/introduction/#i019-precataloging-decisions), [Collection-Level Records](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-b/), [Core-Level Records](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-c/), and [Minimal-Level Records](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-d/). The [Glossary](/DCRMR/glossary/) is still in development and will be incorporated in a future release.
