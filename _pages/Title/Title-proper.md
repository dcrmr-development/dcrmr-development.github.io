## 1.21.1 Element information

<a name="1.21.1.1">1.21.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-4b9291c5-f525-37fd-b661-c469e763ce8a){:target="_blank"}

<a name="1.21.1.2">1.21.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/title/#1011-sources-of-information)

## 1.21.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="1.21.2.1">1.21.2.1</a> A nomen that is a title of manifestation that is selected for preference in a specific application or context.

<a name="1.21.2.2">1.21.2.2</a> An alternative title is treated as part of a title proper.

## 1.21.3 General rule

<a name="1.21.3.1">1.21.3.1</a> Transcribe the Title proper in the form and order in which it is presented on the preferred source of information, unless specifically instructed otherwise (see [Transcription, 0.4.94.05](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.4.94.05)).

## 1.21.31 Words considered part of the title proper

<a name="1.21.31.1">1.21.31.1</a> The title proper is the first element of the description. Title information preceding the [chief title](/DCRMR/glossary/#chief-title) on the preferred source of information is considered part of the title proper if it is grammatically inseparable from the chief title. If the chief title is preceded or followed in the source by other elements of information, transpose these elements to their appropriate elements in the description unless case endings would be affected, the grammatical construction of the information would be disturbed, or the text is visually inseparable from the title proper. In the latter cases, transcribe the information as part of the title proper.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Monsieur Bossu's treatise of the epicke poem</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Title information preceding the chief title is grammatically inseparable)  

>**Example:**  
><CITE>M. Tullii Ciceronis de officiis libri tres</CITE>   
>>(*Comment*: Title information preceding the chief title is grammatically inseparable)   
 
>**Example:**  
><CITE>Walt Disney presents Sleeping Beauty</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Title information preceding the chief title is grammatically inseparable)  

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Portrait of an Irish chief, drawn from life at Wexford</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Size and location of lettering visually indicate that "drawn from life at Wexford" is part of the satiric title, not a statement of responsibility where no person or body is explicitly named)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Near Sale's house, 23 Oct. 1880, Otago Harbour</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Date is visually integral to the title)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

For transposed elements, provide additional title access for the Title proper if considered important (see [Variant title of manifestation, 1.25.357.1](/DCRMR/title/Variant-title-of-manifestation/#1.25.357.1)).

<a name="1.21.31.2">1.21.31.2</a> **Note on the source of the title proper**. Always make a note on the source of the Title proper unless the source is a title page (for printed text resources, see [Data provenance, 0.1.34.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.34.1) and [Note on title, 1.29.31.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.31.1)).

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>A new list of fifty two ships sent to the East-Indies</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from docket title</CITE>  

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>Watch tower in a vineyard</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Still image resource. Title from news service's logbook of photographers' work</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

<a name="1.21.31.3.Y.Y">1.21.31.3.Y.Y</a> **Multiple options for Title proper**. If the preferred source of information contains more than one option for Title proper, use judgment in determining which choice of Title proper will be most useful for the resource in hand. Provide variant title access to other titles if considered important.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Tweed suits the smartest for daily spring wear</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: For this news photograph, the cataloger opted to use the cutline printed above the long caption as the title proper. The slug at the end of the caption, "Washington Fashions, April 22, 1929" could be recorded in a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) or a [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/). The long caption that begins "Mrs. Wm. B. Bankhead, wife of Representative Bankhead of Ala. who makes her home at the Carlton …" can be excerpted in a [Summarization of content](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Summarization-of-content/) note)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

>**Example**:  
><CITE>Franciscus Valesius, D.G. Dux Alenson et Brabant, Comes Flandriae, Protect. Belgicae</CITE>   
>>(*Comment*: Cataloger opted to use title engraved within plate as Title proper in order to collocate multiple impressions of the plate. The letterpress title above the engraving, "Francis of Valois, Duke of Aniou, of Brabant, &c., Earle of Flanders, &c., Protector of the Belgicke libertie," has variant title access and is described in a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/))  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

## 1.21.32 Forms of the title proper

<a name="1.21.32.1">1.21.32.1</a> The title proper can take a variety of forms, some of which are exemplified below:

<a name="1.21.32.2">1.21.32.2</a> Title proper inclusive of grammatically inseparable title information appearing before the chief title on the title page.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Here after foloweth a litel boke called Colyn Cloute</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: “Colyn Cloute” is the chief title)

<a name="1.21.32.3">1.21.32.3</a> Title proper inclusive of an alternative title (a subsequent title joined with a conjunction such as “or”).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>The British carpenter, or, A treatise on carpentry</CITE>  

<a name="1.21.32.4">1.21.32.4</a> Title proper consisting solely of the name of a responsible person or body.  

>**Example:**  
><CITE>C. Sallustius Crispus</CITE>  

>**Example**:  
><CITE>Murray Riss</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Published portfolio entitled by photographer's name)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

<a name="1.21.32.5.Y.Y">1.21.32.5.Y.Y</a> Title proper inclusive of grammatically and visually inseparable dedication.

>**Example**:  
><CITE>To the right honble. the Earl of Moira, this plate, taken on the spot in the County of Downe, representing spinning, reeling with the clock reel, and boiling the yarn, is most respectfully dedicated by ... Wm. Hincks</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

## 1.21.33 Title proper with grammatically inseparable designation

<a name="1.21.33.1">1.21.33.1</a> If a manifestation is in more than one volume and the title proper of each volume includes a grammatically inseparable designation such as numbering that is specific to that volume, supply in square brackets after the first designation a hyphen and the final designation, omitting intermediate designations. Do the same for single-volume manifestations that contain multiple parts. 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Thomas Masterson his first[-second] booke of arithmeticke</CITE>  
>>(*Sources of information read*:  
>Thomas Masterson his first booke of arithmeticke;  
>Thomas Masterson his second booke of arithmeticke)

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Le premier-[quart] volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart</CITE>  
>>(*Sources of information read*:  
>Le premier volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart  
>Le second volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart  
>Le tiers volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart  
>Le quart volume de l'histoire et cronique de messire Iehan Froissart)  

If it is not feasible to do this, transcribe the title proper of the first volume or part without this interpolation and make a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) about the later designation(s) (see [1.29.32.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.32.1)).

## 1.21.335.Y.Y Title elements scattered by design

<a name="1.21.335.1.Y.Y">1.21.335.1.Y.Y</a> If parts of the title are scattered, compose the Title proper based on logical arrangement, taking into account position, typography, size of lettering, etc. If the text could be reasonably assembled in a different order, provide additional title access if considered important.

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>Our choice, Grover Cleveland, A.G. Thurman. Democratic nominees, for president, for vice president</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title assembled from words scattered on four banners, above and below the image</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

## 1.21.34 No title

<a name="1.21.34.1">1.21.34.1</a> If no title can be found within the resource, supply a title from one of the sources listed at [0.1.7.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.7.1) if possible. 

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>[Sermaõ de Santa Isabel Rainha de Portugal]</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from Barbosa Machado</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: A full citation to Barbosa Machado is given in a [Manifestation described by](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/) note (see [9.32.31.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/#9.32.31.1)))  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

<a name="1.21.34.2.Y.Y">1.21.34.2.Y.Y</a> If no title can be supplied from one of the sources listed at [0.1.7.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.7.1) and the resource bears text, use as the Title proper the opening words of the text if these provide a suitable title (that is, a reasonably distinctive title, or alternatively, in the case of still image resources, a title indicative of the content).

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>Ye true-born Englishmen proceed, our trifling crimes detect</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from opening two lines of poem</CITE>

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>H.R. Robinson, 52 Courtland St., Caricatures & prints</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from text surrounding image of wig</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Title is distinctive, even though it is not indicative of the content of the image)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>Benj. Franklin</CITE>    
>Note on title: <CITE>Title from facsimile signature below engraved portrait</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Title is not distinctive, but does provide an indication of the image content)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

<a name="1.21.34.4.Y.Y">1.21.34.4.Y.Y</a> **Printed text resources**. If the opening words of the text are not suitable, or if the beginning of the text is lacking, devise a brief descriptive title, preferably in the language and script of the cataloging agency, and use this devised title, enclosed in square brackets, as the Title proper. Always make a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) indicating the source of the Title proper (see [1.29.33.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.33.1)).

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>[Observations on a bill relative to the militia]</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE>Title devised by cataloger from content</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Opening words “Herewith and the desire of being serviceable in the smallest degree to my country ...” not suitable as title)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

<a name="1.21.34.6.Y.Y">1.21.34.6.Y.Y</a> **Still image resources**. If the material does not contain suitable text or the text is completely illegible, devise a Title proper according to the instructions at [1.21.64.Y.Y](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#12164yy-devised-title-proper-for-still-images). If the title is known to be unintentionally incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless  and provide an appropriate title in square brackets  immediately after (see [0.4.72.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.4.72.1) and [1.21.64.Y.Y](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#12164yy-devised-title-proper-for-still-images)).

## 1.21.35 Title proper with supplementary or section designation or title

<a name="1.21.35.1">1.21.35.1</a> If a manifestation bears a title proper that includes the title of an expression that is supplementary to, or a section of, another expression and appears in two or more grammatically separable parts, transcribe the title that is common to all parts or sections first, followed by the designation(s) and/or title(s) of the supplement(s) or section(s) in order of their dependence.  Always make a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) indicating the original position on the preferred source of information of any transpositions (see [1.29.34.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.34.1)).

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>Faust. Part one.</CITE>  
>Note on title: <CITE> Title page reads: Part one. Faust.</CITE>

If describing an individual issue of a serial, transcribe the numbering of the issue as instructed in [Appendix H](/DCRMR/appendices/Appendix-h/). (Note: Appendix H will be incorporated in a future iteration. Catalogers should continue to consult Appendix H of DCRM(B) for the time being.)

## 1.21.36 Abridgments of the title proper

<a name="1.21.36.1">1.21.36.1</a> **General rule**. *Optionally*, if the title proper is very lengthy and can be abridged without loss of essential information, omit less important words or phrases, using the mark of omission. Do not omit any of the first five words (or, if the Title proper begins with an article, the first six words). Provide fuller title transcription in a Note on title if considered important (see [1.29.393.Y.Y](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#129393yy-omitted-title-information)).

<a name="1.21.36.2">1.21.36.2</a> **Alternative title**. If the title proper contains an alternative title, do not omit any of the first five words of the alternative title (or, if the alternative title begins with an article, the first six words).

<a name="1.21.36.3">1.21.36.3</a> Extend the transcription of the title proper through at least the end of the [chief title](/DCRMR/glossary/#chief-title) of the resource. Apply this provision even if other words in the title proper precede the chief title. If the end of the chief title cannot be determined, break off the transcription at the first grammatically acceptable place, but never within the first five words of the chief title (or, if the chief title begins with an article, the first six words).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>This view of La Valletta, taken from the Gargur Battery during the siege in 1800, is most humbly inscribed by permission to Brigadier General Thomas Graham ...</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The chief title begins "View of La Valletta" but its end point is ambiguous. The full title continues "...then commanding the allied forces in Malta, by his humble servt. Major Jas. Weir, Commandant of the Malta Batallion")  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**    

## 1.21.365.Y.Y Manifestations with a collective title

<a name="1.21.365.1.Y.Y">1.21.365.1.Y.Y</a>  When a multiple unit resource bears a clearly identifiable and consistently used collective title on some or all of its units, transcribe this as the Title proper. Transcribe the Title proper of each unit in a [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) if considered important (see [9.3.32](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9332-contents-notes)).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>The illustration of the Siberian War</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: This collective title is printed on each print in the set, in addition to an individual title for each print)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

<a name="1.21.365.2.Y.Y">1.21.365.2.Y.Y</a> If the collective title of a multiple unit resource is not consistently used from unit to unit and none is given preference in reference sources, choose the title that identifies the resource most adequately and succinctly as the Title proper. Do not enclose the Title proper in square brackets. Provide additional title access if considered important (see 1.25.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

## 1.21.37 Manifestations without a collective title 

### 1.21.371 Two or more expressions named on the preferred source of information

<a name="1.21.371.1">1.21.371.1</a> If a manifestation has no collective title and the preferred source of information bears the titles of two or more individual expressions, other than supplementary matter (see [1.21.35](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#12135-title-proper-with-supplementary-or-section-designation-or-title)), that are contained in the manifestation, transcribe the titles of the individual expressions in the form and order indicated by the sequence, layout, or lettering style on the preferred source of information. See [Element order (1.01.2.5)](/DCRMR/title/#1.01.2.5) for guidance on recording. If using ISBD punctuation, see [Prescribed punctuation (0.2.1.2)](/DCRMR/general-rules/Prescribed-punctuation/#0.2.1.2) for guidance.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Laurentij Vallae elegantiarum Latinae linguae libri sex ; eiusdem De
reciprocatione sui & suus libellus</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example formatted with ISBD punctuation for clarity)

>**Example:**  
><CITE>The serving-man become a queen. Jockey of the green. The lass of Richmond Hill</CITE>

*Optionally*, for still images:

a) Make a separate description for each separately titled expression, linking the separate descriptions with "With" notes (see [On carrier unit with, 9.34.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/On-carrier-unit-with/#9.34.3.1))

b) If the titles are so numerous that naming each one is cumbersome, supply a collective title from one of the resources listed at [0.1.7.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.7.1) if possible, otherwise devise a collective title for the whole manifestation following the guidelines at [1.21.64.Y.Y](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#12164yy-devised-title-proper-for-still-images)


### 1.21.372 One or more expressions not named on the preferred source of information

<a name="1.21.372.1">1.21.372.1</a> If the manifestation has no collective title, and one or more expressions contained in the manifestation are not named on the preferred source of information, either: 

a) Transcribe the title and [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/) from the preferred source of information, and name the other expressions(s) in a contents note (see [Note on manifestation, 9.3.32](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9332-contents-notes)) 

b) Make a separate description for each separately titled expression, linking the separate descriptions with “With” notes (see [On carrier unit with, 9.34.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/On-carrier-unit-with/#9.34.3.1))  

c) Supply a collective title from one of the sources listed at [0.1.7.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#0.1.7.1)

d) Devise a collective title for the whole manifestation, preferably in the language and script of the cataloging agency, and use this devised title, enclosed in square brackets, as the Title proper

>**Example:**  
><CITE>[Acts of Parliament enacted in 1732]</CITE>

>**Example:**  
>Title proper: <CITE>Isidora</CITE>  
>Note on manifestation: <CITE>Volume 3 also includes the author’s Fanchette (pages [87]-232) and Lettre d’un paysan de la Vallée-Noir (pages [233]-307)</CITE>  

## 1.21.42.Y.Y Single-sheet printed text manifestations

### 1.21.421.Y.Y General rule

<a name="1.21.421.1.Y.Y">1.21.421.1.Y.Y</a> In general, transcribe the information presented beginning with the first line of printing. If the printing is arranged in columns with no information preceding the body of the text, begin the transcription with the top line of the extreme left column (extreme right column in the case of languages that are read right to left). Retain in the transcription dates, addresses, and other information necessary for identification. Use judgment, but in case of doubt, start the transcription with the first words of printed text on the sheet. If the initial text is grammatically independent of the succeeding material and is one of the following, however, begin the transcription after it without using the mark of omission:
+ caption to an illustration
+ copyright statement
+ device
+ edition statement
+ production, publication, distribution, manufacture statement
+ motto
+ official numbering
+ page number
+ part of an illustration or ornament
+ price
+ tabular material

If the initial text has been omitted, indicate the nature and position of the omitted material in a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) if considered important (see [1.29.35.1](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.35.1)).

### 1.21.422.Y.Y Title proper of a single-sheet printed text manifestation

<a name="1.21.422.1.Y.Y">1.21.422.1.Y.Y</a> If there is a word or phrase obviously intended as the [Title of manifestation](/DCRMR/title/Title-of-manifestation/) that is not the first line of printing, transcribe it as the entire title proper, omitting information appearing before it on the page without the mark of omission. In general, apply this instruction only when such a title is not integrated grammatically with the rest of the text, is set off typographically, and has as its sole function the naming of the resource as a whole. When such a title is selected, also give in a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) at least the first five words of the first line of printing (see [1.29.35.2](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.35.2)). In case of doubt as to the selection of the title proper, start the transcription with the first line as described above.

<a name="1.21.422.2.Y.Y">1.21.422.2.Y.Y</a> If there is no word or phrase obviously intended as a title, transcribe the text as found through at least a relatively distinctive word or phrase. If the distinctive word or phrase is not near the beginning of the transcription, less important words or phrases preceding it may be omitted, using the mark of omission. Do not, however, abridge the transcription before the sixth word. If the text is very lengthy, end the transcription at the first grammatically acceptable place after a distinctive word or phrase; the omitted material may be summarized in a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) if considered important (see [1.29.35.3](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.35.3)).

### 1.21.423.Y.Y Two or more printed texts expressions with a collective title on a single sheet

<a name="1.21.423.1.Y.Y">1.21.423.1.Y.Y</a> If a resource printed on a single sheet contains two or more expressions and has a collective title, transcribe only the collective title as the title proper. Make a formal or informal contents note for the expressions (see [Note on manifestation, 9.3.32](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9332-contents-notes)).

### 1.21.424.Y.Y Two or more printed texts expressions without a collective title on a single sheet

<a name="1.21.424.1.Y.Y">1.21.424.1.Y.Y</a> If a resource printed on a single sheet contains two or more expressions but does not have a collective title, transcribe as the title proper the first title or opening words of the text. Make a formal or informal contents note and include in it the titles of the additional works (see [Note on manifestation, 9.3.32](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9332-contents-notes)). 

<a name="1.21.424.2.Y.Y">1.21.424.2.Y.Y</a> If the sheet is printed on both sides and it is impossible to determine which side should be read first, make a separate metadata description for each side of the sheet, and include a formal “With, on other side” note in each record (see [On carrier unit with, 9.34.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/On-carrier-unit-with/#9.34.3.1)).

### 1.21.425.Y.Y Two or more printed text expressions or manifestations with separate publication, distribution, or manufacture statements on a single sheet

<a name="1.21.425.1.Y.Y">1.21.425.1.Y.Y</a> If there are two or more manifestations printed on a single sheet and each has its own publication, distribution, or manufacture statement, or there is other conclusive evidence that they were intended to be separately issued, make a separate description for each manifestation that was intended to be issued separately. Include a formal “With” note in each record indicating that the manifestations were printed on a single sheet and that they were “intended to be separated” (see [On carrier unit with, 9.34.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/On-carrier-unit-with/#9.34.3.1)). If there are two or more manifestations printed on a single sheet giving the appearance that they were possibly intended to be separated, but there is no conclusive evidence that this is the case, follow the provisions of [1.21.384.1](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#1.21.384.1), and always make a [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) indicating that they were “possibly intended to be separated” (see [9.3.3.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9.3.3.1)).

## 1.21.64.Y.Y Devised title proper for still images

<a name="1.21.64.1.Y.Y">1.21.64.1.Y.Y</a> If a suitable Title proper cannot be derived from the beginning words of text (see [1.21.34.2.Y.Y](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#1.21.34.2.Y.Y)), and cannot be supplied from another source (see [1.21.34.1](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#1.21.34.1)), devise a brief descriptive title, preferably in the language and script of the cataloging agency, and use this devised title, enclosed in square brackets, as the Title proper. 

<a name="1.21.64.2.Y.Y">1.21.64.2.Y.Y</a> For untitled images of a documentary nature, give the objective factual content clearly and concisely, enclosed in square brackets. Details of the content, nature, scope, context, purpose, etc., of the material may be fully described in the note area. Include the following kinds of information in the devised title, as appropriate and feasible:
* The subject type or form of material, e.g., view(s), portrait(s), sketch(es)

## 1.21.68.Y.Y Titles for still images within a series

<a name="1.21.68.1.Y.Y">1.21.68.1.Y.Y</a> In the context of still images, the term "series" refers to a set of manifestations related to one another by the fact that all (or most) of the manifestations bear a collective title applying to the set as a whole, or are referred to in reference sources by a collective title. Unlike traditional multiple unit resources, it is not always clear what would constitute a complete series. 

<a name="1.21.68.2.Y.Y">1.21.68.2.Y.Y</a> If a manifestation in a series bears only a collective title, provide a Title proper according to the provisions of [1.21.34](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#12134-no-title) or [1.21.64.Y.Y](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/#12164yy-devised-title-proper-for-still-images). Do not record the series title as the Title proper unless describing the series itself as a multiple unit resource.

<a name="1.21.68.3.Y.Y">1.21.68.3.Y.Y</a> If a manifestation in a series bears both a collective title and a grammatically separable unit title that is dependent on the title of the larger resource for sufficient identification, transcribe the title of the larger resource first, followed by the title(s) of the part(s) or section(s) in order of dependence. Make a [Note on title](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/) regarding the arrangement if considered important (see [1.29.395.1.Y.Y](/DCRMR/title/Note-on-title/#1.29.395.1.Y.Y)).

>**Example:**   
><CITE>Ishpiming, residence of Mr. Wm. S. Corby, Chevy Chase, Maryland. Exterior, elevation facing south</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: "Exterior, elevation facing south" is dependent on the identification of the building, which is given on each drawing)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Catalogue général officiel. Tome second. Groupe II, Oeuvres d'art, classes 7 à 10</CITE> 
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**   

<a name="1.21.68.4.Y.Y">1.21.68.4.Y.Y</a> If a manifestation in a series bears both a series title and a grammatically separable unit title that is not dependent on the title of the larger resource for sufficient identification, transcribe the title of the unit being described as the Title proper. Record the collective title for the larger resource as a [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Orpheus and Euridice</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The unit title is not dependent on the collective title, which is "The famous Rahl & Bradley living bronze statues")  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

<a name="1.21.68.5.Y.Y">1.21.68.5.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, always transcribe both the collective title and the unit title.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>The famous Rahl & Bradley living bronze statues. Orpheus and Euridice</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Cataloger opted to transcribe both titles as the Title proper because the unit title is so minimal)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**
