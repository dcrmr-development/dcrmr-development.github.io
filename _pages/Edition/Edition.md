## 3.01.1 Sources of information

<a name="3.01.1.4.Y.Y">3.01.1.04.Y.Y</a> **Printed text resources**. The sources of information for the edition elements are the title page, other preliminaries, colophon, and dust jacket (see [Data provenance, 0.1.5](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#015-sources-of-information)), in that order of preference. If an edition element is transcribed from elsewhere than the title page, always indicate its source in a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) (see [3.26.31.1](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.31.1)). Do not take an edition statement from a source outside the manifestation itself.

<a name="3.01.1.06.Y.Y">3.01.1.06.Y.Y</a> **Still image resources**. Take an edition statement (that is, an indication of a print's  "state") from any source. Identification of the state will usually come from a catalogue raisonné or other reference source, or simply by comparison of the item in hand with another exemplar of the manifestation. If taken from a source other than the manifestation itself, indicate that it was taken from outside the manifestation by enclosing it in square brackets. Always make a [Note on edition statement](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/) to indicate the source of the information (see [3.26.42.1.Y.Y](/DCRMR/edition/Note-on-edition-statement/#3.26.42.1.Y.Y)).
