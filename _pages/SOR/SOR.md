## 2.01.1 Sources of information

<a name="2.01.1.1">2.01.1.1</a> The source of information for the statement of responsibility is the title page(s) ([Data provenance, 0.1.5](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/#015-sources-of-information)). The preferred source of information for multipart monographs is the title page of the first volume. The preferred source of information for single-sheet manifestations is the whole sheet, including both sides (see [Data provenance, 0.1](/DCRMR/general-rules/Data-provenance/)).

## 2.01.2 Element order

<a name="2.01.2.1">2.01.2.1</a> Element order for Statement of responsibility elements is integrated with the instructions for [Title](/DCRMR/title/) elements (see [1.01.2](/DCRMR/title/#1012-element-order)).

## 2.01.3 Form and order of information

<a name="2.01.3.1">2.01.3.1</a> Transcribe [Title of manifestation](/DCRMR/title/Title-of-manifestation/) and Statement of responsibility information in the form and order indicated by the sequence, layout, or lettering style on the preferred source of information, unless specifically instructed otherwise (see [Transcription, 0.4.94.05](/DCRMR/general-rules/Transcription/#0.4.94.05)).

<a name="2.01.3.2">2.01.3.2</a> For transposed elements, always make a [Note on statement of responsibility](/DCRMR/sor/Note-on-statement-of-responsibility/) to indicate the original position on the title page (see [2.29.32.1](/DCRMR/sor/Note-on-statement-of-responsibility/#2.29.32.1)).

*Exception*: For still image resources without title pages, do not note transposition.
