## 6.26.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="6.26.2.1">6.26.2.1</a> A physical or chemical substance applied to a base material of a manifestation.

## 6.26.3 General rule 

<a name="6.26.3.1">6.26.3.1</a> Record an applied material of the manifestation if considered important. Use one or more terms from the [RDA Value Vocabularies: RDA Material](http://www.rdaregistry.info/termList/RDAMaterial/){:target="_blank"} and indicate the source.

>**Example:**  
>Applied material: <CITE>ink</CITE>  
>Source code of term: <CITE>rdamat</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example includes the MARC source code of term for clarity)

>**Example:**  
>Applied material: <CITE>watercolor</CITE>  
>Source code of term: <CITE>rdamat</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example includes the MARC source code of term for clarity)

<a name="6.26.3.2">6.26.3.2</a> If none of the terms in the RDA vocabulary is appropriate, record a suitable term from another standardized vocabulary and indicate its source.

<a name="6.26.3.3">6.26.3.3</a> When multiple applied materials are identified in a manifestation, record as many terms as appropriate, with the predominant one, if any, first.

<a name="6.26.3.4">6.26.3.4</a> If a manifestation is known to have multiple applied materials but not all can be readily identified, record *mixed materials.*

<a name="6.26.3.5">6.26.3.5</a> Record more detailed descriptions of the applied materials used to produce the manifestation as [Details of applied material](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-applied-material/) if considered important (see [6.265.3.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-applied-material/#6.265.3.1)).
