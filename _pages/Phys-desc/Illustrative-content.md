Tables containing only words or numerical data are excluded.

Tables containing only words and/or numerical data are excluded.

## 6.22.3 General rule

<a name="6.22.3.1">6.22.3.1</a> To indicate the presence of illustration, use the term general “illustration” or “illustrations,” as appropriate, from [RDA Value Vocabularies: RDA Illustrative Content](http://www.rdaregistry.info/termList/IllusContent/){:target="_blank"}.

Make a note on these [Details of illustrated content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-illustrative-content/) if considered important (see [6.225.3.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-illustrative-content/#6.225.3.2)). 

<a name="6.22.3.4">6.22.3.4</a> **Illustrated title pages**. Treat illustrated title pages as illustrative content.  Make a note to indicate any title-page illustration so treated if considered important (see [Details of illustrative content, 6.225.3.3](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-illustrative-content/#6.225.3.3)).

<a name="6.22.3.5">6.22.3.5</a> **Graphic processes or techniques**. *Optionally*, record controlled terms for graphic processes or techniques used in producing illustrative content in [Production method](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Production-method/) (see [6.27.3.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Production-method/#6.27.3.1)). Make a note describing these graphic processes or techniques in more detail if considered important (see [Details of illustrative content, 6.225.3.4](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-illustrative-content/#6.225.3.4)).

## 6.22.35 Number of illustrations

<a name="6.22.35.1">6.22.35.1</a> Record the number of illustrations when their number can be ascertained readily (e.g., when the illustrations are listed and their numbers stated).
