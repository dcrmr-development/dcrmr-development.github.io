## 6.25.1 Element information

<a name="6.25.1.1">6.25.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-f96b31a0-8dd8-324c-a2e7-28f9540f665e){:target="_blank"}

<a name="6.25.1.2">6.25.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/phys-desc/#6011-sources-of-information) 

## 6.25.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="6.25.2.1">6.25.2.1</a> An underlying physical material of a manifestation.

## 6.25.3 General rule

<a name="6.25.3.1">6.25.3.1</a> Record the base material of the manifestation if considered important. Use one or more terms from the [RDA Value Vocabularies: RDA Material](http://www.rdaregistry.info/termList/RDAMaterial/){:target="_blank"} and indicate the source.

>**Example:**  
>Base material: <CITE>paper</CITE>  
>Source code of term: <CITE>rdamat</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example includes the MARC source code of term for clarity)

<a name="6.25.3.2">6.25.3.2</a> If none of the terms in the RDA vocabulary is appropriate, record another suitable term from a standardized vocabulary and indicate its source. Prefer the [RBMS Controlled vocabularies: Paper terms](http://rbms.info/vocabularies/paper/alphabetical_list.htm){:target="_blank"} for terms for specific types of paper.

>**Example:**  
>Base material: <CITE>Japan vellum</CITE>  
>Source code of term: <CITE>rbpap</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example includes the MARC source code of term for clarity)

<a name="6.25.3.23.Y.Y">6.25.3.23.Y.Y</a> If a manifestation is known to have multiple applied materials but not all can be readily identified, record "mixed materials".

<a name="6.25.3.25.Y.Y">6.25.3.25.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, in addition to "mixed materials", record the materials that can be readily identified as [Details of applied material](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-applied-material/) (see 6.265.SOMETHING.SOMETHING). 

<a name="6.25.3.3">6.25.3.3</a> Make a note recording more detailed descriptions of base materials if considered important (see [Details of base material, 6.255.3.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-base-material/#6.255.3.1)).

## 6.26.6.Y.Y Still image resources

<a name="6.25.6.1.Y.Y">6.25.6.1.Y.Y</a> Record the base material of still images if considered important, e.g., if the base material is unusual as a support for the image medium (i.e., it cannot reliably be inferred from the carrier type), if it is customary to name the support for that medium (e.g., for oil paintings), or if such features as texture, color, or weight are unusually important in relation to the image.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>leather</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: For a photograph on leather)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>wood</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>canvas</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.25.6.2.Y.Y">6.25.6.2.Y.Y</a> **Photographic negatives**. Specify the base material if it is other than safety film.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>nitrate film negative</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>glass plate negative<CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.25.6.3.Y.Y">6.25.6.3.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, always specify the base material.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>safety film</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**
