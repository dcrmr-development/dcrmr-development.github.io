## 6.23.1 Element information

<a name="6.23.1.1">6.23.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content?externalId=en-US_ala-26e5e1f2-b7fb-383b-954a-b2560eb6eb40){:target="_blank"}

## 6.23.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="6.23.2.1">6.23.2.1</a> An indication of the presence of colour, tone, etc., embodied by a manifestation.

<a name="6.23.2.2">6.23.2.2</a> Black, white, single colour shades of black, single colour tints of white, and single colour tones of gray are considered to be single colours. Colour content applies to an expression with a value of "cartographic image", "cartographic moving image", "cartographic three-dimensional form", "notated movement", "notated music", "performed movement", "still image", "text", "three-dimensional moving image", "three-dimensional form", or "two-dimensional moving image" for content type.

## 6.23.3 General rule

<a name="6.23.3.1">6.23.3.1</a> Describe color characteristics using one or more terms from the [LC Vocabulary for Color Content](https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/mcolor.html){:target="_blank"}.

## 6.23.32 Hand coloring in printed resources

<a name="6.23.32.1">6.23.32.1</a> Hand-colored material is material to which color is applied in a separate production stage by brush, stencil, or another manually applied method. 

<a name="6.23.32.2">6.23.32.2</a> If there is strong evidence that all exemplars of the manifestation were issued with hand coloring applied before distribution, always record the presence of color as issued in [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/) (see [6.235.33.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.33.1)). Evidence for hand coloring applied before distribution may include statements within the resource itself or scholarly research. In general, do not treat the presence of hand coloring in a single item as evidence that the edition was issued with hand coloring. In case of doubt, assume that not all exemplars of the manifestation were issued with hand coloring applied before distribution.

>**Example:**  
>Color content: <CITE>hand colored</CITE>  
>Details of color content: <CITE>Illustrations are hand colored, as issued</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Title contains statement “embellished with colored engravings”)

<a name="6.23.32.3">6.23.32.3</a> If there is strong evidence that some exemplars of the manifestation were issued with hand coloring applied before distribution, and some without, record this information as [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/) instead of as Color content (see [6.235.33.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.33.2)).

<a name="6.23.32.4">6.23.32.4</a> Record the presence or absence of hand coloring in an item if considered important (see [Modification of item, 9.41.3.2](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Modification-of-item/#9.41.3.2)).

## 6.23.4.Y.Y Printed text resources

### 6.23.31 Original color in printed textual resources

<a name="6.23.31.1">6.23.31.1</a> Treat illustrations printed with tint blocks (e.g., chiaroscuro woodcuts, tinted lithographs) as color illustrations.

<a name="6.23.31.2">6.23.31.2</a> If both the text and illustrations are printed in a single color, do not describe the illustrations as “color.” Make a note on the color of the ink if considered important (see [Details of color content, 6.235.31.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.31.1)).

<a name="6.23.31.3">6.23.31.3</a> In general, do not record printed color as color content unless it appears in illustrations.  Make a note on the color of ink in textual matter if considered important (see [Details of color content, 6.235.31.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.31.2)).

For incunabula, make a note on color printing in textual matter if present (see [Details of color content, 6.235.31.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.31.2)).

### 6.23.33 Color of base material

<a name="6.23.33.1">6.23.33.1</a> Do not record the presence of color in base materials (e.g., paper) as color content. Make a note if considered important (see [Details of color content, 6.235.35.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/#6.235.35.1)).

## 6.23.6.Y.Y Still image resources

### 6.23.62.Y.Y General rule

<a name="6.23.62.1.Y.Y">6.23.62.1.Y.Y</a> If considered important, indicate that the image is black and white.

>Example:  
>black and white  
>>(*Comment*: Transparencies are normally assumed to be color)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.23.62.2.Y.Y">6.23.62.2.Y.Y</a> Record color descriptive of an applied material as Color content, if considered important. For color descriptive of base material, see 6.23.SOMETHING.SOMETHING.

### 6.23.63.Y.Y Original color in still images

<a name="6.23.63.1.Y.Y">6.23.63.1.Y.Y</a> Record color that is applied as part of the original production, if considered important. See 6.23.SOMETHING.SOMETHING 32.X.X for "hand coloring", i.e., color applied in a separate production stage by brush, stencil, or other method.

<a name="6.23.63.2.Y.Y">6.23.63.2.Y.Y</a> For color prints where each color is printed from a separate surface, record the color content as "color". Record the number (i.e., the number of plates, stones, or blocks combined to make the finished print) and the names of the colors as [Details of color content](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-color-content/) (see 6.235.SOMETHING.SOMETHING), if considered important.

### 6.23.64.Y.Y Color of base materials

<a name="6.23.64.1.Y.Y">6.23.64.1.Y.Y</a> Record the presence of color on base materials (e.g. paper) as Color content, if considered important. Make a note giving further details if considered important (see Details of color content, 6.235.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).
