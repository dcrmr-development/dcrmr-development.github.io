## 6.24.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="6.24.2.1">6.24.2.1</a> A measurement of a carrier or a container of a manifestation.

<a name="6.24.2.2">6.24.2.2</a> Dimensions include measurements of height, width, depth, length, gauge, and diameter.

## 6.24.21.Y.Y DCRMR elaboration on scope

<a name="6.24.21.1.Y.Y">6.24.21.1.Y.Y</a> Note: This element in DCRMR covers dimensions for all formats, while the [RDA Toolkit](https://www.rdatoolkit.org/){:target="_blank"} covers the dimensions of still image resources in a separate element. Instructions for still image resources in Dimensions map to [RDA Toolkit: Dimensions of still image](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-03f0bb95-75c3-30ab-90e8-804bc3c36cdc){:target="_blank"}.


## 6.24.3 General rule

<a name="6.24.3.1">6.24.3.1</a> Record the dimensions of a manifestation (based on the exemplar in hand) in centimeters, using the metric symbol "cm". Round a fraction of a centimeter up to the next full centimeter. If a manifestation measures less than 10 centimeters, record the dimensions in millimeters, using the metric symbol "mm". 

>**Example:**  
> <CITE>18 cm</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: A manifestation measuring 17.1 centimeters in height)
 
>**Example:**  
> <CITE>99 mm</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: A manifestation measuring between 98 and 99 millimeters in height)

<a name="6.24.3.2">6.24.3.2</a> If one of the measurements would normally be given in millimeters and one in centimeters, record both measurements in millimeters.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>95 x 120 mm</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: A manifestation measuring between 94 and 95 mm in height and between 11 and 12 cm in width)

<a name="6.24.3.3">6.24.3.3</a> If more than one exemplar of the manifestation is known and the dimensions of the different exemplars vary, record the dimensions as issued, if they can be determined. Otherwise, record the dimensions of the largest known exemplar.  Record the dimensions of the other exemplars in [Note on dimensions of item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/) (see [9.44.3.2](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/#9.44.3.2)).

## 6.24.33 Volumes

### 6.24.331 Height

<a name="6.24.331.1">6.24.331.1</a> If a volume is bound, measure the height of the binding. 

>**Example:**  
> <CITE>27 cm</CITE>

<a name="6.24.331.2">6.24.331.2</a> When the height of the text block differs by 3 centimeters or more from the height of the binding *and* the binding was issued by the publisher, specify both. For descriptions of item-specific bindings, see [Modification of item, 9.41.35.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Modification-of-item/#9.41.35.1).

>**Example:**  
> <CITE>text block 12 cm, in binding 20 cm</CITE>

### 6.24.333 Width

<a name="6.24.333.1">6.24.333.1</a> If the width of a volume is greater than the height, or less than half the height, record the height x width. 

>**Example:**  
> <CITE>20 x 32 cm</CITE>

>**Example:**  
><CITE>20 x 8 cm</CITE>

### 6.24.335 Differing sizes

<a name="6.24.335.1">6.24.335.1</a> If the volume as issued contains separate text blocks of varying dimensions, record the height (or height × width) of the binding only. If considered important, record the heights of the text blocks in [Note on dimensions of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-dimensions-of-manifestation/) (see [6.245.3.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-dimensions-of-manifestation/#6.245.3.2)) or [Note on dimensions of item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/) (see [9.44.3.2](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/#9.44.3.2)).

<a name="6.24.335.2">6.24.335.2</a> If the volumes of a multipart set differ in size, record the smallest or smaller size and the largest or larger size, separated by a hyphen.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>24-28 cm</CITE>

## 6.24.35 Single-sheet manifestations

<a name="6.24.35.1">6.24.35.1</a> For a single-sheet manifestation issued unfolded, record the height x width. 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>32 x 25 cm</CITE>

<a name="6.24.35.2">6.24.35.2</a> If a sheet is issued in folded form, but is designed to be used unfolded (e.g., with the chief part occupying a whole side of the sheet), add the dimensions of the sheet when folded.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>22 x 28 cm, folded to 22 x 10 cm</CITE>

<a name="6.24.35.3">6.24.35.3</a> If the sheet is not folded as issued, or in cases of uncertainty, do not record the height x width when folded. If the folded dimensions are important, record this information in [Note on dimensions of item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/) (see [9.44.3.3](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/#9.44.3.3)).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>24 x 38 cm</CITE>  
> Note on dimensions of item: <CITE>Folded by later owner to 24 x 19 cm</CITE>

<a name="6.24.35.4">6.24.35.4</a> When describing sheets designed to be used as folded (see [6.21.429](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Extent-of-manifestation/#621429-single-sheet-manifestations)), record the height of the sheet when folded.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>18 cm</CITE>  

## 6.24.36.Y.Y Scrolls

<a name="6.24.36.1.Y.Y">6.24.36.1.Y.Y</a> For material created as a scroll (as opposed to material rolled for storage), record the height × width of the unrolled scroll, followed by the height × diameter of the rolled scroll.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>9 × 52 cm rolled to 9 × 3 cm in diameter</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

<a name="6.24.36.2.Y.Y">6.24.36.2.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, add measurement of dowels or handles if they are original.

>**Example:**   
><CITE>9 × 52 cm rolled to 9 × 3 cm in diameter, on dowel 35 cm long</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**  

## 6.24.37 Containers

<a name="6.24.37.1">6.24.37.1</a> If a container was issued with the resource, record the height x width x depth of the container if considered important. Record these dimensions in addition to the dimensions of the volume or sheet.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>33 cm, in box 34 x 25 x 6 cm</CITE>

<a name="6.24.37.2">6.24.37.2</a> If the container was not issued with the resource, do not record the dimensions of the container in the dimensions element.  In situations of uncertainty, assume that the container was not issued with the resource. Record the dimensions of the container in a [Note on dimensions of item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/) if considered important (see [9.44.3.4](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/#9.44.3.4)). 

<a name="6.24.37.3">6.24.37.3</a> If the resource is in more than one container, and the containers are all of the same size, record the dimensions of a single container.

<a name="6.24.37.4">6.24.37.4</a> If the containers differ in size, record the dimensions of the smallest or smaller and the largest or larger size.

## 6.24.6.Y.Y Dimensions of still image resources

### 6.24.61.Y.Y General rule

<a name="6.24.61.1.Y.Y">6.24.61.1.Y.Y</a> Record the dimensions of a still image in centimeters, using the metric symbol "cm". Round a fraction of a centimeter up to the next full centimeter. If a manifestation measures less than 10 centimeters, record the dimensions in millimeters, using the metric symbol "mm". 

<a name="6.24.61.2.Y.Y">6.24.61.2.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, record all dimensions in millimeters, regardless of the manifestation’s size. This option is particularly desirable for plate marks of intaglio prints, which are traditionally measured in millimeters. See 6.SOMETHING.SOMETHING

<a name="6.24.61.3.Y.Y">6.24.61.3.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, for manifestations larger than 2 meters in the shortest dimension, record the height dimension(s) in meters and use the metric symbol "m". 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>on stretcher 3 x 18 m</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Painting is a panorama)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.24.61.4.Y.Y">6.24.61.4.Y.Y</a> Record the dimensions of a still image in terms of height x width. Height and width are defined with reference to the position in which the image would be viewed. Height is always expressed first. Always indicate the area (e.g., image, sheet, plate mark, etc.) to which a set of dimensions applies. 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>sheet 18 x 14 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.24.61.5.Y.Y">6.24.61.5.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, record orientation as [Details of layout](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-layout/) (see 6.285.SOMETHING.SOMETHING). 

>**Example:**  
>Dimensions: <CITE>sheet 18 x 14 cm</CITE>  
>Details of layout: <CITE>vertical orientation</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.24.61.6.Y.Y">6.24.61.6.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, add other dimensions to help identify the manifestation (e.g., when there is a large size difference between the image and the carrier). When recording the dimensions of the image followed by the dimensions of the carrier, separate the dimensions by a comma and precede the dimensions of the carrier by "on". 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>image 13 x 14 cm, on sheet 33 x 42 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>image 23 x 19 cm, on sheet 34 x 30 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

><CITE>image and text 37 x 44 cm, on sheet 42 x 48 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.24.61.7.Y.Y">6.24.61.7.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, record in [Note on manifestation](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/) (see 6.24.SOMETHING.SOMETHING) the size of a mount which is substantially larger than the image or carrier, as when a photographic print is affixed to a non-standard mount.

<a name="6.24.61.8.Y.Y">6.24.61.8.Y.Y</a> **Conventions**. Different types of graphic material require different types of measurements. Although the metric system has become the standard for recording dimensions, it may be desirable for some types of still image to give additional information using other systems of measurement (such as the imperial system) or manufacturers’ sizes.  For circular shapes, diameter is recorded instead of height and width,  and depth is added for containers. The areas measured for different graphic types also vary: for example, it is customary to measure plate marks of intaglio prints, papers of twentieth-century photographic prints, and standard mounts of nineteenth-century photographic prints such as cabinet cards. Record measurements according to the general rules (see 6.24.SOMETHING.SOMETHING), supplemented by material-specific instructions (see 6.24.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

<a name="6.24.61.9.Y.Y">6.24.61.9.Y.Y</a> **Born-digital images**. Omit this element for born-digital images in electronic form.

### 6.24.62.Y.Y Non-rectangular and irregular shapes

<a name="6.24.62.1.Y.Y">6.24.62.1.Y.Y</a> For circular shapes, give the diameter, specified as such. 

>**Example:**  
><CITE>image diameter 20 cm on sheet 32 x 23 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.24.62.2.Y.Y">6.24.62.2.Y.Y</a> For a non-circular shape, record (as height x width) the measurements of the smallest rectangle within which the shape could fit. Include a word or phrase to describe the shape.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>oval image 18 x 24 cm, on sheet 23 x 25 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>irregular sheet 12 x 17 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>irregular pentagon image 41 x 36 cm, on sheet 57 x 48 cm</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: The sheet is not an irregular shape)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>image and text 24 x 44 cm, on octagon shaped sheet 26 x 45 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
><CITE>oval image and text 39 x 29 cm, on sheet 58 x 47 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

### 6.24.63.Y.Y Sight measurements and framed or cased images

<a name="6.24.63.1.Y.Y">6.24.63.1.Y.Y</a> If the dimensions of the full image cannot be determined because of an non-removable mat, case or other container, record the dimensions of the visible image. Also, record the dimensions of the container, if considered important  (see Note on manifestation, 9.3.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

>**Example:**  
>Dimensions: <CITE>visible image 26 x 30 cm</CITE>  
>Note on manifestation: <CITE>In mat 34 x 38 cm</CITE>   
>>(*Comment*: Window mat and backing are glued together)  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

### 6.24.64.Y.Y Still images consisting of more than one sheet

<a name="6.24.64.1.Y.Y">6.24.64.1.Y.Y</a> When an image consists of more than one sheet, measure the assembled image area, the individual items, or both, as appropriate. If the image is on more than one sheet and is in two or more segments designed to fit together to form one image, record the dimensions of the complete image, followed by the dimensions of the individual segments as appropriate to image format. Separate the dimensions by a comma.

>**Example:**  
>Dimensions: <CITE>full image 276 x 1105 mm, plate marks 279 x 384 mm and 281 x 368 mm or smaller</CITE>  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>3 prints forming 1 picture</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
>Dimensions: <CITE>full image 41 x 280 cm, each sheet 41 x 56</CITE>  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>5 photographic prints forming 1 panorama</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

*Optionally*, record only the complete image dimension.

*Optionally*, record only the dimensions of individual sheets if it is difficult to assemble or to measure the complete images. 

<a name="6.24.64.2.Y.Y">6.24.64.2.Y.Y</a> Make a [Note on dimensions of item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/) to indicate whether the repository’s instance is assembled or not, if considered important (see 9.44.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

### 6.24.65.Y.Y Specific categories of still images

<a name="6.24.652.1.Y.Y">6.24.652.1.Y.Y</a> For intaglio prints, record the dimensions of the plate mark, measured at the approximate mid-point of each side.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>plate mark 27 x 34 cm</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.24.652.2.Y.Y">6.24.652.2.Y.Y</a> If the sheet has been trimmed inside the plate mark, or the plate mark is indistinct, and the plate mark dimensions of a more perfect example cannot be ascertained, give another measurement applicable to the manifestation as a whole.

<a name="6.24.66.1.Y.Y">6.24.66.1.Y.Y</a> When all parts of a multipart resource are the same size, follow the instructions for recording the dimensions of a single still image (see 6.24.SOMETHING.SOMETHING). 

<a name="6.24.66.2.Y.Y">6.24.66.2.Y.Y</a> When two sizes are involved, give both sets of dimensions.

>**Example:**  
>Dimensions: <CITE>sheets 21 x 26 cm and 11 x 13 cm</CITE>  
>Note on dimensions of manifestation: <CITE>Sheets are 8 x 10 and 4 x 5</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.24.66.3.Y.Y">6.24.66.3.Y.Y</a> When there are more than two sizes, give the dimensions of the largest followed by the words "or smaller". If no one manifestation has both the largest height and the largest width, give the full dimensions of the two largest manifestations separated by a comma, and followed by a comma and the words "or smaller". If considered important, provide individual dimensions in a Note on dimensions of manifestation.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>plate marks 150 x 185 mm or smaller</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

### 6.24.67.Y.Y Dimensions of container 

<a name="6.24.67.1.Y.Y">6.24.67.1.Y.Y</a> Record the dimensions of a container in terms of height x width and depth.

<a name="6.24.67.2.Y.Y">6.24.67.2.Y.Y</a> For individual still images that are issued in multiple (such as prints), record the dimensions of the container (frame, case, etc.) in addition to the dimensions of the resource. Record the container dimensions in the Dimensions element only if the container is known to have been issued with the resource. Generally treat the container as item specific and record the dimensions in a [Note on dimensions of item](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/) (see [9.44.3.4](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-dimensions-of-item/#9.44.3.4)), if considered important.

<a name="6.24.67.3.Y.Y">6.24.67.3.Y.Y</a> For individual unique resources (such as original paintings), record in the Dimensions element dimensions of the container in addition to the dimensions of the carrier or carriers, if the container is considered part of the resource itself. Otherwise, record container dimensions in a [Note on dimensions of manifestation](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-dimensions-of-manifestation/) (see 6.245.SOMETHING.SOMETHING), if considered important. 

For instructions on recording container dimensions when only part of an image is visible, see 6.24.SOMETHING.SOMETHING.

<a name="6.24.67.4.Y.Y">6.24.67.4.Y.Y</a> For multiple unit resources created or issued in a container, always record the dimensions of the container, either in addition to the dimensions of the carrier or carriers or, optionally, as the only dimension.
