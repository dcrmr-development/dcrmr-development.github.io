## 6.27.1 Element information

<a name="6.27.1.1">6.27.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-9bdf25b8-f2f7-31d1-a3a0-7f416e4bc667){:target="_blank"}

<a name="6.27.1.2">6.27.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/phys-desc/#6011-sources-of-information) 

## 6.27.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="6.27.2.1">6.27.2.1</a> A process used to produce a manifestation.

## 6.27.3 General rule

<a name="6.27.3.1">6.27.3.1</a> Record the process or technique used to produce the manifestation if considered important. Prefer a term from the [RDA Value Vocabularies: RDA Production Method](http://www.rdaregistry.info/termList/RDAproductionMethod/){:target="_blank"}, such as:  
* engraving
* etching
* printing

<a name="6.27.3.2">6.27.3.2</a> If none of the terms in the RDA vocabulary is appropriate, record another suitable term from a standardized vocabulary (such as the printing and printing processes and techniques hierarchy of the [Art & Architecture Thesaurus Online](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/){:target="_blank"}) and indicate its source.

>**Example:**  
>Production method: <CITE>intaglio printing</CITE>  
>Source code of term: <CITE>aat</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Example includes the MARC source code of term for clarity)

<a name="6.27.3.23.Y.Y">6.27.3.23.Y.Y</a> When multiple techniques or processes are known to have been employed in a single graphic item or each item of a multipart resource but are fully or partially unidentified, or too numerous to list, use the terms "multiple processes".

<a name="6.27.3.25.Y.Y">6.27.3.25.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, in addition to "multiple processes" multiple processes, record the materials that can be readily identified as [Details of production method](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-production-method/) (see 6.275.SOMETHING.SOMETHING). 

<a name="6.27.3.3">6.27.3.3</a> When multiple techniques or processes are identified in a manifestation, record as many terms as appropriate, with the predominant one, if any, first.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>aquatint</CITE>  
><CITE>etching</CITE>  
>>(*Comment*: Print done in aquatint with some etching)

<a name="6.27.3.4">6.27.3.4</a> Make a note recording more detailed descriptions of the processes or techniques used to produce a manifestation in [Details of production method](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-production-method/) if considered important (see [6.275.3.1](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Details-of-production-method/#6.275.3.1)).

<a name="6.27.3.5.Y.Y">6.27.3.5.Y.Y</a> **Photographic or photomechanical processes**. If considered important, give the trade name, photographic or photomechanical process, or other technical specification.  Prefer a term from a controlled vocabulary such as [Art & Architecture Thesaurus Online](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/){:target="_blank"}).
