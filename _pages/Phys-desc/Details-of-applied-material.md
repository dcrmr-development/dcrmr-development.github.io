## 6.265.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="6.265.2.1">6.265.2.1</a> Details of a physical or chemical substance that is applied to a base material of a manifestation.

## 6.265.3 General rule 

<a name="6.265.3.1">6.265.3.1</a> Record details of applied material if considered important (see [Applied material, 6.26.3.5](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Applied-material/#6.26.3.5)).

<a name="6.265.3.2.Y.Y">6.265.3.2.Y.Y</a> *Optionally*, if "mixed materials" has been recorded in [Applied material](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Applied-material/), record in details of applied material any materials that can be identified (see 6.26.SOMETHING.SOMETHING).

>**Example:**  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>1 drawing</CITE>  
>Details of applied material: <CITE>mixed materials, including charcoal and graphite with white chalk highlights</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.265.3.3.Y.Y">6.265.3.3.Y.Y</a> When multiple unit resources include items containing different applied materials, provide a general indication or record the specific number for each category. Terms for applied materials  may be freely combined as necessary for brevity and clarity.

>**Example:**  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>1 album (85 prints and 5 drawings)</CITE>  
>Details of applied material: <CITE>85 etchings with drypoint and engravings and 5 mixed materials including black and brown ink, gray and brown wash, graphite, watercolor</CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

>**Example:**  
>Extent of manifestation: <CITE>1 album (9 drawings)</CITE>  
>Details of applied material: <CITE> </CITE>  
>>**(*Ingest comment*: example needs review)**

<a name="6.265.3.4.Y.Y">6.265.3.4.Y.Y</a> To record free text that combines description of applied material, base material, mount or production method, make a [Note on carrier](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-carrier/) (see [6.355.3.2](/DCRMR/phys-desc/Note-on-carrier/#6.355.3.2)).
