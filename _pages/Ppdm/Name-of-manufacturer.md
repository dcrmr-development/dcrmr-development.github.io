<a name="5.32.37.1">5.32.37.1</a> If no manufacturer’s name can be conjectured, record “manufacturer not identified” in square brackets if considered important.

## 5.32.38 Name of manufacturer transcribed as part of another element

If transcribing a manufacturer name as part of another element, do not abridge or expand the name of manufacturer simply because it repeats or omits information given elsewhere in the description.

<a name="5.32.39.1">5.32.39.1</a> If the manufacturer’s name appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the name in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as Name of manufacturer. If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the name that appears first as Name of manufacturer. Transcribe the remaining manufacturer name(s) as [Parallel name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-name-of-manufacturer/). For transposed elements, always make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source (see [5.34.34.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.34.7)).
